### 🧠 Agent 2 — Memory Retention Chatbot

This project is a memory-enabled conversational AI agent built using [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.dev/langgraph/), [LangChain Core](https://python.langchain.com/docs/core/), and [ChatOllama](https://ollama.com). Unlike simple chatbots, this agent **remembers your entire conversation**, enabling multi-turn, context-aware interactions — just like a real assistant.

- 🧠 **Contextual Memory** – Retains and utilizes full chat history during a session
- 💬 **Natural Dialogue** – Provides context-aware responses across multiple turns
- 📄 **Conversation Logging** – Saves the entire chat to `Memory_retention.txt`
- ⚙️ **Powered by `phi`** – Uses the lightweight and efficient `phi` model from Ollama
- 🧩 **Modular Code** – Built with LangGraph's stateful architecture and easily extendable
