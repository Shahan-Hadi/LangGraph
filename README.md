# ðŸ§  LangGraph Projects with ChatOllama

This repository showcases two simple but powerful AI projects built using [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.dev/langgraph/) and [ChatOllama](https://ollama.com/). Both projects use a lightweight local LLM (`phi`) to demonstrate conversational agents â€” one with memory retention and one as a basic stateless bot.
