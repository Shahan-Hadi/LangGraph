## üöÄ Projects Overview

### 1. ü§ñ Conversational AI Agent with Memory Retention

**Description:**
A conversational AI system built with [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.dev/langgraph/) and [ChatOllama](https://ollama.com/), capable of engaging users in dynamic conversations with context retention across turns.

**Features:**
- Uses LangGraph to model the flow of conversation as a state graph.
- Integrates a lightweight LLM (e.g., `phi`, `llama3`) from Ollama.
- Maintains memory of past user interactions.
- Can be extended for custom use cases like customer service, virtual assistants, or chatbots with long-term memory.

**Tech Stack:**
- Python
- LangGraph
- LangChain
- ChatOllama
- LLM (via Ollama)

### 2. üßë‚Äçüè´ Face Recognition Attendance System

**Description:**
A computer vision-based attendance system that uses face recognition to automate attendance marking. Ideal for use in classrooms or workplace environments.

**Features:**
- Real-time face detection using OpenCV.
- Facial recognition using LBPH or other models.
- Automatically stores attendance logs.
- GUI interface using Tkinter (if applicabl
